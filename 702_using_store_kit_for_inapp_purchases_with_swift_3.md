## 702 - Using Store Kit for In-App Purchases with Swift 3

* App categories no longer relevant for subscriptions
* Territory pricing available
* Save old prices for existing users when increasing price (early adopter pricing)
* Upgrades and downgrades in subscriptions
* Payment Queue is the source of truth!
* Use `simulatesAskToBuyInSandbox` to test iCloud family purchases
* Let `StoreKit` handle as much flow as possible
* For local receipt validation use hardcoded values!
